## Pack My Bag
Suppose you are going on a hike and you want to be prepared for the worst to happen. 
You want to bring items that will maximize your chance of survival, but you can only carry so much weight in your bag.
We will use a genetic algorithm to help us optimize our selection of items based on 3 criteria:
* How much weight can our bag handle
* How much each item weighs
* How many survival points does each item provide
